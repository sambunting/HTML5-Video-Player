HTML5-Video-Player
==================

Here is an HTML5 video player which supports most browsers. It has several features such as volume controlls, full screen and seek. I am in the process though of making a more advanced HTML5 player, untill then this will have to do.

Usage
===========

1) Copy and paste the code from **vp-main.html** and paste it in your document.
2) Edit the several `source` tags inside the `video` element. It is reccomended to do all three and convert the videos to MP4, WebM and Ogg Theora because it will support much older browsers.
3) Copy and paste the folowing code **beneath** the code that you coppid down earlier.

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="vp-stylesheet.css">
    <script type="text/javascript" src="vp-javascript.js"></script>
    
That should be it, you should be good to go now, If you do have any issues with it though, please open an issue so I can help you out.
